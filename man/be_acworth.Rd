\usage{
be_acworth(dat, wl = "wl", ba = "ba", et = "et", inverse = TRUE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data that has the independent and dependent variables (data.table)}

\item{wl}{name of the water level column (character).}

\item{ba}{name of the barometric pressure column (character).}

\item{et}{name of the Earth tide column (character).}

\item{inverse}{\code{logical} whether the barometric relationship is inverse
(TRUE means that when the barometric pressure goes up the measured water
level goes down (vented transducer, depth to water), FALSE means that when 
the barometric pressure goes up so does the measured pressure 
(non-vented transducer)).}

\description{
Implementation of Acworth et. al. 2016.  This is basically the 
transfer function value for the semi-diurnal band.
